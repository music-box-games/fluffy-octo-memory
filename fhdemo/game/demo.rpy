    dad "That sounds like a good idea, alright, I don't think I'll see you after I take your stuff up to the dorms..."
    mc "Wait, Dad."
    "Before he could reach down to pick up my lugge I stepped over and wrapped my arms around him."

    "His hand clenched against the back of my head."
    "My father and I were rarely ever apart when I was younger. Most everything I know how to do, I owe to him."
    "He always wore this cologne that made him smell like lavender and pine trees. It isn't overbearing but I could still make it out through his coat."
    "Leaving my friends for a year is going to be tought, but it can't be helped, they were all very understanding when we were texting lsat night."
    "I think it's all just hitting me now. Everything's changing and there's no going back."
    dad "I love you Hayato. You know that right?"
    mc "I know Dad, I know."
    "It's only a year."
    "We let go of each other and he reaches down to lift my luggage."

    "My dad never expressed his emotions as much as I think he'd like to. My grandfather was very muhc of the \"suck it up and walk it off\" variety."
    dad "I'll be sure to email you, I now Anko will."
    "The thought of my cute little sister sitting diligently at a desk trying to write a cohoesive letter makes me feel a little happy, something I don't think will happen often at this place."
    "It may just be me, but this place feels more like a western college than a high school for the disabled. Idon't know, Yale, Hardvard, Brown. All the famous red brick, ivy-covered colleges."
    "I wave my Dad off and make my way toward the school."

    "It is a bit chilly out, the walk to and from the dorms isn't that far. Maybe a hundred yards? I'll probably only need to wear a coat if it gets super cold."

    "Before I can even try to open the door for her, she darts in front of me and grabs the door handle herself."
    "She flings the door open and rushes inside. The door slowly closes, while I look around for anyone to confirm what I just saw."
    "After taking a second to confirm with myself that I wasn't imagining things, I turn back to the door and reach for the handle."
    "The door flings back open, I pull my hand out of the way just in time."

    "Sure enough, it's that same girl. Out of breath and with a considerably less menacing look on her face."
    "She has short coffee-brown hair. Parted in the middle with one side tucked behind her ear, and the other side covering up much of her other eye. Her eyes are a bright brown, almost a shiny amber color."
    "If it wasn't for the small curl at the edge of her lips, she'd give of a rather mysterious vibe. That and she has what appear to be hiking book on, definitely not the attire of a demure girl."
    girl "Hey, you're new here, aren't you?"
    "She asks between breaths."
    "Part of me wants to ask for an apology, or at the very least an explanation as to why that's the way she wants to introduce herself to me."
    mc "Uh-yeah. My names Hayato."
    "She stops herself. She takes in a deep breath and slowly lets it out, her breath visible in the cold."

    myo "Again, sorry about that."
    mc "No, no, it's fine. Why were you running, by the way?"
    "She just has her normal uniform on. At the very least I'd expect someone that was out running to have some gym clothes on, or something similar considering the temperature."

    "Masuyo steps back a big, holding the door open for me. I step inside and she immediately points to the staircase in front of us, still breathing beavily as she begins to talk."
